# Used technologies:

This is a RN app that uses redux to manage the state globally and redux-persist + react-native-async-storage to persist users favorite movies.

This app uses react-native-vector-icons to display icons.

# NOTE:

This app is developed on windows environment so all CocoaPods installs are missing, it would be great to run the app on an android device using:

`yarn`

`npx react-native run-android`
